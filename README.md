Eric Moore

I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at Michigan Tech. I did not attend another college previously but I've done a lot of independent work with Computer Science related topics. I've had four years of information technology experience and one summer worth of web development.

I've advanced through courses very quickly at Michigan Tech and am currently on a 3 year graduation plan with a 1-year Masters planned afterwards. I have a strong interest in Operating Systems and other low level aspects of Computer Science, although I don't currently have a very good understanding of them.
